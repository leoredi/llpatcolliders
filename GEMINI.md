# Agent Instructions (Gemini)

Start by reading `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` and follow them as the canonical repository policy.

Then use:
- `PHYSICS.md` for physics assumptions and formulas
- `CODING.md` for architecture and code-path references

Do not modify vendored/external directories listed in `AGENTS.md`.
