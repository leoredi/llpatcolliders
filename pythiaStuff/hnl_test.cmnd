! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run.
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive.

! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 1000             ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 3          ! how many aborts before run stops

! 2) Settings related to output.
Main:writeRoot = off
Next:numberCount = 1000

! 3) Set up the beams.
Beams:idA = 2212
Beams:idB = 2212
Beams:eCM = 13000.

! 4) Define HNL particle.
9900012:new = HNL HNLbar 2 0 0 10.0 0 0 0 10.0
9900012:mayDecay = true
! HNL -> e- e+ nu_e
9900012:addChannel = 1 1.0 0 11 -11 12

! 5) Set up the process.
HiggsSM:gg2H = on
25:onMode = off
25:addChannel = 1 1.0 0 9900012 -9900012
