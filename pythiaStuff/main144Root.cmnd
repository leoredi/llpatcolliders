# This command file enables the generation of a ROOT file that stores
# parts of the Pythia event record using main144. The amount of
# information stored per particle, is defined in the classes in
# main144RootEvent.h, and the implementation of their Pythia-sepcific
# init methods in main144.cc. Change and recompile for customization
# of the ROOT file.
