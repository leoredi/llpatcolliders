# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a physics research codebase for analyzing Long-Lived Particle (LLP) detection at collider experiments. It combines Monte Carlo simulation, geometric modeling, and statistical analysis to study particle decay probabilities in detector geometries.

## Core Architecture

### Simulation Pipeline
1. **Event Generation**: `main381_modified_for_root.cc` generates Higgs boson events using PYTHIA 8, outputting ROOT files with particle kinematics and decay information
2. **Data Processing**: Jupyter notebooks (`Investigation.ipynb`, `Pythia_simulation.ipynb`) analyze ROOT simulation output
3. **Geometric Analysis**: Python scripts model detector geometries and calculate decay probabilities

### Key Components

**Particle Data Flow**:
- PYTHIA 8 simulation → ROOT files → CSV particle data → Analysis scripts
- Particle data includes: event ID, particle ID, kinematics (pt, eta, phi, momentum, mass)

**Geometric Modeling**:
- `neutral3D.py`: Full 3D tube geometry with ray-casting for omnidirectional particle flux
- `neutralv2.py`: Simplified 2D detector geometry using Shapely
- Both calculate decay probabilities using exponential decay laws

**Analysis Scripts**:
- `decayProbPerEvent.py`: Event-level decay probability calculations with lifetime scanning
- Creates exclusion plots comparing with experimental limits from `external/` directory

## Dependencies and Setup

### C++ Code (PYTHIA Simulation)
```bash
# Requires PYTHIA 8 and ROOT framework installed
g++ -o simulation main381_modified_for_root.cc `root-config --cflags --libs` -lpythia8
./simulation  # Outputs ROOT file
```

### Python Analysis
```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy trimesh shapely tqdm

# Also requires ROOT with Python bindings (PyROOT)
# Installation varies by system - typically via conda-forge or system package manager
```

### Running Analysis
```bash
# Direct execution of analysis scripts
python decayProbPerEvent.py    # Event-level decay analysis
python neutral3D.py            # 3D geometric analysis  
python neutralv2.py            # 2D geometric analysis

# Jupyter notebooks for ROOT data analysis
jupyter notebook Investigation.ipynb
jupyter notebook Pythia_simulation.ipynb
jupyter notebook Pythia_time_intersection_calculation.ipynb
```

## Key Data Structures

**Particle CSV Format**: `event,id,pt,eta,phi,momentum,mass`
- Two particles per event (particle/antiparticle pairs)
- Used by decay probability calculations

**Tube Geometry**: 
- Defined by corrected vertex paths in 3D space at z=22m
- Radius ~1.54m, used for ray-detector intersections

**ROOT Tree Structure**:
- Branches: energy, x, y, z, t, pid, phi, theta, px, py, pz, MC_event
- Includes mother/sister/daughter particle relationships

## Physics Context

The code models scenarios where:
- Long-lived particles are produced in Higgs decays
- Particles travel distances before decaying
- Decay probability depends on particle lifetime and path length through detector
- Goal is to set exclusion limits on particle properties (mass vs decay length)

Analysis compares calculated sensitivities with existing experimental limits from MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, and ANUBIS experiments.
